# The Wallpaper Home Jekyll Theme

A simple theme for building a personal site with Jekyll. The home
page uses light text over a picture of your choice. The rest of the pages are
arranged within a light or a dark background. Besides the home page, the theme
includes a layout for a blog and a portfolio.
