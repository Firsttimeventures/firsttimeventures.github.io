# Wallpaper Home

A simple jekyll theme for a personal page.  This text here will be your
*welcome* message, you should be able to use all the *markdown* you want
since this is {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %}. You can also use math, both
inline $$ y = f(x) $$ and in display mode:

$$
f(x | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}
e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

Edit this content in `index.md`.
